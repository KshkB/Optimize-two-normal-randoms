    "With the shift in focus from prices to growth rates, recall that the portfolio $Z_{\\lambda, \\delta} = \\lambda X + \\delta Y$ represents the fund which grows at the rate $\\lambda r_X + \\delta r_Y$ over a given day. Accordingly, it grows at an *average* daily rate $\\mu_Z = \\lambda\\mu_X + \\delta \\mu_Y$. If the growth rates $r_X, r_Y$ are perfectly correlated, then holding $Y$ represents either adding to one's holding position in $X$ or shorting $X$. Either way, the growth rate is unaffected. After all, the growth rate in one unit of $X$ is the same as the growth rate of one million units of $X$. The expected *return* of course differing by a factor of a million. But this is ultimately constrained by our initial investment amount $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our random variables represent growth rates, it does not make sense to consider the case of perfectly correlated stocks. Indeed, in order to acheive a higher or lower rate of growth it is necessary to combine independent or imperfectly correlated stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see this is by heeding the above warning. From the above formulae for unit holdings $\\lambda_X, \\delta_Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if $\\mu_X = \\mu_Y$, then $\\lambda_X, \\delta_Y$ are both undefined;\n",
    "- if $\\mu_X = (1-\\delta)\\mu_Y$, then concerning the $X$ holdings, $\\lambda_X = 0$;\n",
    "- if $\\mu_Y = (1-\\lambda)\\mu_X$, then concerning the $Y$ holdings, $\\delta_Y = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now recall that if $X, Y$ are perfectly correlated, then they lie in a linear relationship, i.e., are linearly *dependent*. In the case they are \"canonically dependent\", $X = Y$, by the first dot point we see it will not make sense to study stochasticity in the daily growth rates of $X, Y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, recall that if $X$ and $Y$ are linearly dependent, the equation for determining the optimal parameters $\\lambda^*, \\delta^*$ is undetermined. We can solve uniquely for a linear combination $\\gamma^*$ of $\\lambda, \\delta^*$, but there will always be a degree of freedom in choosing $\\lambda^*, \\delta^*$. By the second and third dot point above, this degree of freedom can be exploited to set either $\\lambda_X$ or $\\delta_Y$ to zero. This accords with the common sense understanding above that if $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated, holding both means to either add to our holding or short position in one. This can only affect the sign of the growth rate but not its magnitude (e.g., $-X$ grows at an expected rate of $-\\mu_X$).\n"
